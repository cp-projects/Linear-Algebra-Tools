# Linear-Algebra-Tools



Working on writing my own library which implaments linear algebra formulas with a specific mind toward using these implamentations for data science projects.
This is not because I believe my implamentations to be superior to those already out there (they're not) it is for me to really practice and learn to understand
what is going on under the hood of the more popular data science libraries so I will be more effective at using them in the future.
