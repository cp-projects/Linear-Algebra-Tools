# Linear-Algebra-Tools

Working on writing my own library which implements linear algebra formulas with a specific mind toward using these implementations for data science projects. This is not because I believe my implementations to be superior to those already out there (they're not) it is for me to really practice and learn to understand what is going on under the hood of the more popular data science libraries so I will be more effective at using them in the future.

Most recent updates are in the "new orginzation" folder, I have the stuff in the main folder for my own comparison during the transition to a more modular system.
