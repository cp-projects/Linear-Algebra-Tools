# Linear-Algebra-Tools

Test

Working on writing my own library which implements linear algebra formulas with a specific mind toward using these implementations for data science projects. This is not because I believe my implementations to be superior to those already out there (they're not) it is for me to really practice and learn to understand what is going on under the hood of the more popular data science libraries so I will bemore effective at using them in the future.
